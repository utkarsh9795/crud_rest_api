# CRUD_REST_API

## Overview

CRUD_REST_API is a full-featured RESTful API built using Node.js and Express.js, designed to perform basic Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on a simple data model. This project demonstrates how to build a scalable API that can serve as a foundation for web and mobile applications.

## Features

- **RESTful Architecture**: Follows REST principles for resource manipulation.
- **CRUD Operations**: Implemented endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting resources.
- **Data Persistence**: Uses MongoDB for data storage with Mongoose for object data modeling.
- **Input Validation**: Implements data validation using Joi to ensure integrity before database operations.
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling to manage exceptions and provide meaningful error messages.
- **Environment Configuration**: Utilizes dotenv for managing environment variables for better security and flexibility.
- **Testing**: Includes a suite of automated tests using Jest to ensure API reliability.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for server-side programming.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for building APIs.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing data.
- **Mongoose**: ODM library for MongoDB and Node.js.
- **Joi**: For input validation.
- **Jest**: For testing the API endpoints.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or later)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (or use a cloud-based MongoDB service)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node package manager, comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CRUD_REST_API.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd CRUD_REST_API
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your MongoDB connection string:

   ```
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://your_mongodb_uri
   PORT=5000
   ```

5. Start the application:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### API Endpoints

- **Create a resource**: `POST /api/resources`
- **Read all resources**: `GET /api/resources`
- **Read a single resource**: `GET /api/resources/:id`
- **Update a resource**: `PUT /api/resources/:id`
- **Delete a resource**: `DELETE /api/resources/:id`

### Example Request

#### Create a Resource

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/resources -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "Sample Resource", "description": "This is a sample resource."}'
```

### Testing

Run the tests using:

```bash
npm test
```
